\section{Business problem}

In chemistry many reactions require constant presence of scientist or technician to perform shaking of tubes with reactants, sometimes
it is required to be done every 30 minutes and this process continues up to all day long. It is extremely monotonous
and exhausting work. As a consequence, if employee is tired enough, it may lead to mistakes and ruin experiment. Additionally,
it may consume precious time of scientists when there are not enough other employees in laboratory to assign task of shaking.

% the routine caused by a need to shake tubes every ~10 min and to pay someone for doing it evey day

\section{Business goal}

The objective of project is \textit{to automate process} of shaking as much as possible to reduce strain on employees, free up time
for scientists and lower the possibility of errors during the process.

\section{Desired outcome}

It is assumed that by using modern robotics and \textit{computer vision} technologies it is achievable to exclude human factor from process
of shaking completely (after it's launch). Consequently, this will solve all the stated problems.
