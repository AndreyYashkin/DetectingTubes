\section{Current Solution}

\subsection{Solution based on OpenCV using filters}

First attempt to create desired \textit{computer vision} system was done using OpenCV and image filtering
in order to locate the positions of tubes on image. All tubes were marked with colored rings.
A specially tuned filter found tubes by their rings. However, that approach had several unacceptable cons
\begin{itemize}
	\item tubes making was not reliable, because rings were not fixed and could break away
	\item image filter had to be manually recalibrated after any light changes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solution based on DNN}

There was an another solution based on deep neural network. It did not require to make any special marks
an tubes and was reliable regardless of the environment around tubes, but required a big prepared taring dataset
to educate neural network. Desire the good prediction quality of tubes positions on pictures it could not be
used to find their position in space and was not trained to find other important types of objects like manipulator or shaker.
