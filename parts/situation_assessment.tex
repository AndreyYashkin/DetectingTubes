\section{Data sources description}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Dataset contains 1500 pictures in jpg format of tubes with its bounding boxes represented as files in .xml format. Each picture may contain one or many tubes (or even none).
	
	\item The tubes are photographed at different angles, with different lighting intensities. In the dataset there are pictures in which the tubes are obstructed by large objects.
	
	\item The quality of the pictures is quite high: all tubes are clearly visible to the human eye.
	
	\item If necessary, the dataset can be easily expanded for our needs. No external data / metadata needed.
	
	\item All data is on Google Drive with access by link. There is no need for special data protection, since it does not fall under the influence of NDA.
\end{itemize}
